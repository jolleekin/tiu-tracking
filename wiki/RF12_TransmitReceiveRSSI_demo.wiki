= Demo package: transmit/receive/Analog-RSSI using RFM12 module - version 1.0 posted =

source https://tiu-tracking.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

This package demonstrates wireless communication on hobby frequency 
band (i.e 433MHz...) using RFM12B transceiver modules and ATMega328 uC.

https://tiu-tracking.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rf12_tx_rx_v1/schematic/3296687815_007f613b6b_o.png

Our purpose is testing these RFM12B module functions: transmit/receive/Analog-RSSI, which could be considered applying for our project later.

There are two different approaches will be introduced:
    * polling, no checksum based on Benedikt's library
    * interrupt with checksum based on RF12 arduino library by Jeelabs 
	

== Notes: ==
 * No collision avoidance is considered yet in this version
 * To get ARSSI output, you may have to manually solder on a wire to a resistor to access this pad (location shown in red circle)(thanks to Stephen Eaton).
 * Schematic provided by Jeelabs, used for both transmiting receiving modules
 * Antennas required for best performance, Ideally at 433MHz ~ 17cm length
 * Yeah, I used arduino board to program the chips and monitor the serial outputs
